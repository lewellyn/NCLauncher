Simplicity has a love/hate relationship.

NCLauncher is a home replacement for the Barnes & Noble nookcolor.

NCLauncher is designed to be very simple, yet functional. The end goal is to be a fusion between the stock B&N Home and more traditional home screens. This means giving up a bit of functionality from either end, but it is hoped that most people find the trade-off worth it.

NCLauncher is both free and open-sourced, you can find the source repository on github and if you have any input please feel free to provide it. Now on to the features list...

Features:
- Based off of HeLauncher, which is based off Launcher+
- Access to Barnes & Noble nookcolor-specific functionality
- 5 screens
- Drop to Uninstall
- Scrollable Widgets
- Re-sizable Widgets
- Screen indicators
- Ten custom dockbar styles

Simple is the idea, get over it.
